## Introduction

I often have the need to do some data analysis, formatting, pretty printing, etc of data extracted from log files and the like:

- format some json
- explain a subnet
- format some byte numbers
- format timestamps
- etc..

I don't feel particularly comfortable using 3rd party tools usually written in php to work with possibly sensitive data so I'd prefer to have a known toolkit of tools available at my disposal to do these types of tasks.

## What is wat?

`wat` is a set of Javascript based tools hosted on a github-pages site. These tools provide a number of task-specific data formatting and rendering functionalities.

## What is wat built with?

I'd like to build `wat` with:

- Precompilation to Javascript using Travis (build `master` -> `gh-pages`)
- Elm-lang source
- **Minimal** third-party run-time libraries

## Why is wat built with elm-lang?

Because `elm-lang` is interesting. Thats all :)
